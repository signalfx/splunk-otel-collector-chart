# Example: Enable OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation
#
# This example demonstrates how to enable zero-code eBPF-based instrumentation
# for automatic collection of application traces and network metrics.
#
# IMPORTANT PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS:
# - eBPF instrumentation ONLY works on Linux nodes
# - Windows nodes are NOT supported and will be excluded via nodeSelector
# - Kubernetes 1.24+ is required

# Enable the OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation subchart
#
# Note: The eBPF instrumentation will instrument applications automatically.
# It will inject trace context into application requests and collect metrics
# from kernel probes.
