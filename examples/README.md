# Examples of Helm Chart value configurations and resulting rendered Kubernetes manifests

## Structure

Each example has a directory where each of the following is included.
- README.md: A short description about the example.
- A Helm values configuration file to demonstrate the example.
- A rendered_manifests directory that contains the rendered Kubernetes manifests for the example.
  - Search for "CHANGEME" to find the values that must be changed in order to use the rendered manifests directly.

## Using Install Examples

Usage example:
```
helm install my-splunk-otel-collector --values path-to-values-file.yaml splunk-otel-collector-chart/splunk-otel-collector
```

## Common Configurations

The Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector Chart can be configured to export data to
to the following targets:
- [Splunk Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-enterprise.html)
- [Splunk Cloud Platform](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-cloud-platform.html)
- [Splunk Observability Cloud](https://www.observability.splunk.com/)

All the provided examples must include one of these two configuration sets to
know which target to export data to.

Use these configurations for exporting data to Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud Platform.
```yaml
# Splunk Platform required parameters
clusterName: CHANGEME
splunkPlatform:
  token: CHANGEME
  endpoint: http://localhost:8088/services/collector
```

Use these configurations for exporting data to Splunk Observability Cloud.
```yaml
# Splunk Observability required parameters
clusterName: CHANGEME
splunkObservability:
  realm: CHANGEME
  accessToken: CHANGEME
```
