# Auto-instrumentation

The process of adding observability code to your application so that it produces telemetry data is known as
instrumentation. There are two main approaches to instrumentation in OpenTelemetry: auto-instrumentation and manual
instrumentation.

Auto-instrumentation

- Usually is the easiest way to setup instrumentation for applications
- OpentTelemetry leverages Kubernetes to implement auto-instrumentation in such a way that your applications can be
  instrumented not by updating the application source code but rather by utilizing Kubernetes resources.
- Supports a subset of instrumentation libraries compared to manual instrumentation

Manual Instrumentation

- Takes more setup effort compared to auto-instrumentation but offers more customizability
- Requires editing application source code to include pre-built OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries
- Supports more instrumentation libraries and customization of the exported telemetry data compared to
  auto-instrumentation

In particular, auto-instrumentation is useful for applications that use widely popular frameworks and libraries, as
these frameworks often have pre-built instrumentation capabilities already available.

## Steps for setting up auto-instrumentation

### 1. Deploy the Helm Chart with the Operator enabled

- **Operator Deployment (Required)**
  - `operator.enabled`: Set to `true` to enable deploying the operator.
    - **Required**: This configuration is necessary for the operator's deployment within your cluster.

- **TLS Certificate Management (Required)**
  - **Using cert-manager (Recommended)**
    - `certmanager.enabled`: Enable cert-manager by setting to `true`.
      - **Check Before Enabling**: Ensure cert-manager is not already installed to avoid multiple instances.
      - **Recommended**: Cert-manager simplifies the management of TLS certificates, automating issuance and renewal.

  - **Alternative Methods**
    - **Automatically Generate a Self-Signed Certificate with Helm**
      - `operator.admissionWebhooks.autoGenerateCert.enabled`: Set to `true` to enable Helm to automatically create a self-signed certificate.
        - **Use Case**: Suitable when cert-manager is not installed or preferred.
    - **Provide Your Own Certificate**
      - Ensure both `operator.admissionWebhooks.certManager.enabled` and `operator.admissionWebhooks.autoGenerateCert.enabled` are set to `false`.
      - `operator.admissionWebhooks.cert_file`: Path to your PEM-encoded certificate.
      - `operator.admissionWebhooks.key_file`: Path to your PEM-encoded private key.
      - `operator.admissionWebhooks.ca_file`: Path to your PEM-encoded CA certificate.
        - **Use Case**: Ideal for integrating existing certificates or custom certificate management processes.

- **Deployment Environment (Required)**
  - **Via `values.yaml` (Recommended)**
    - `environment`: Required configuration to set the deployment environment attribute in exported traces.

  - **Alternative Methods**
    - **Instrumentation Spec**
      - `operator.instrumentation.spec.env`: Use with the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable to specify the deployment environment.

- **Auto-instrumentation Configuration Overrides (Optional)**
  - **[Default Instrumentation](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/examples/enable-operator-and-auto-instrumentation/rendered_manifests/operator/instrumentation.yaml) Object Deployment**
    - Automatically deploys with `operator.enabled=true`.
    - Supports AlwaysOn Profiling when `splunkObservability.profilingEnabled=true`.
  - **Customizing Instrumentation**
    - `operator.instrumentation.spec`: Override values under this parameter to customize the deployed opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1 Instrumentation object.
      - **Examples**
        - [Custom environment span tags](../examples/enable-operator-and-auto-instrumentation/instrumentation/instrumentation_add_custom_environment_span_tag.yaml)
        - [trace sampler](../examples/enable-operator-and-auto-instrumentation/instrumentation/instrumentation-add-trace-sampler.yaml)
        - [partially enable profiling](../examples/enable-operator-and-auto-instrumentation/instrumentation/instrumentation-enable-profiling-partially.yaml).

```bash
# Check if cert-manager is already installed, don't deploy a second cert-manager.
kubectl get pods -l app=cert-manager --all-namespaces

# If cert-manager is not deployed, make sure to add certmanager.enabled=true to the list of values to set
helm install splunk-otel-collector -f ./my_values.yaml --set operator.enabled=true,environment=dev splunk-otel-collector-chart/splunk-otel-collector
```

### 2. Verify all the OpenTelemetry resources (collector, operator, webhook, instrumentation) are deployed successfully

```bash
kubectl get pods
# NAME                                                            READY   STATUS
# splunk-otel-collector-agent-lfthw                               2/2     Running
# splunk-otel-collector-cert-manager-6b9fb8b95f-2lmv4             1/1     Running
# splunk-otel-collector-cert-manager-cainjector-6d65b6d4c-khcrc   1/1     Running
# splunk-otel-collector-cert-manager-webhook-87b7ffffc-xp4sr      1/1     Running
# splunk-otel-collector-k8s-cluster-receiver-856f5fbcf9-pqkwg     1/1     Running
# splunk-otel-collector-opentelemetry-operator-56c4ddb4db-zcjgh   2/2     Running

kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io
# NAME                                      WEBHOOKS   AGE
# splunk-otel-collector-cert-manager-webhook              1          14m
# splunk-otel-collector-opentelemetry-operator-mutation   3          14m

kubectl get otelinst
# NAME                    AGE   ENDPOINT
# splunk-otel-collector   3s    http://$(SPLUNK_OTEL_AGENT):4317
```

### 3. Instrument application by setting an annotation

Enable instrumentation by adding the `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-{instrumentation_library}` annotation.
This can be applied to a namespace for all its pods or to individual PodSpec objects, available as part of
Deployment, Statefulset, and other resources.

**Annotation Values:**
- `"true"`: Inject the `Instrumentation` resource from the namespace.
- `"my-instrumentation"`: Use the `Instrumentation` custom resource (CR) instance in the current namespace.
- `"my-other-namespace/my-instrumentation"`: Use the `Instrumentation` CR instance from another namespace.
- `"false"`: Do not inject.

**Annotations for Different Libraries:**

**Java:**

```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"
```

**NodeJS:**

```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs: "true"
```

**Python:**

```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: "true"
```

**.NET:**
.NET auto-instrumentation uses annotations to set the .NET [Runtime Identifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).
Current RIDs: `linux-x64` (default) and `linux-musl-x64`.

```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet: "true"
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/otel-dotnet-auto-runtime: "linux-x64"
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/otel-dotnet-auto-runtime: "linux-musl-x64"
```

**Go:**
Go auto-instrumentation requires `OTEL_GO_AUTO_TARGET_EXE`. Set via annotation or the Instrumentation resource.

```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-go: "true"
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/otel-go-auto-target-exe: "/path/to/container/executable"
```
_Note: Elevated permissions are automatically set for Go auto-instrumentation._

**Apache HTTPD:**

```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-apache-httpd: "true"
```

**Nginx:**

```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nginx: "true"
```

**OpenTelemetry SDK:**

```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-sdk: "true"
```

#### Annotation Examples:

**Example 1:**

For a nodejs application, with helm chart installed as:

```bash
helm install splunk-otel-collector --values ~/src/values/my_values.yaml ./helm-charts/splunk-otel-collector --namespace monitoring
```

_Note: The default `Instrumentation` object name matches the helm release name. The default instrumentation name for this example is `splunk-otel-collector`._

If the current namespace is `monitoring`:
- Use any of the following annotations:
  - `"instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs": "true"`
  - `"instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs": "splunk-otel-collector"`
  - `"instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs": "monitoring/splunk-otel-collector"`

If the current namespace is not `monitoring`, like `default` or `my-other-namespace`:
- Use the annotation:
  - `"instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs": "monitoring/splunk-otel-collector"`

**Example 2:**

For a nodejs application, with helm chart installed as:

```bash
helm install otel-collector --values ~/src/values/my_values.yaml ./helm-charts/splunk-otel-collector --namespace o11y
```

_Note: The default `Instrumentation` object name matches the helm release name. The default instrumentation name for this example is `otel-collector`._

If the current namespace is `o11y`:
- Use any of the following annotations:
  - `"instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs": "true"`
  - `"instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs": "otel-collector"`
  - `"instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs": "o11y/otel-collector"`

If the current namespace is not `o11y`, like `default` or `my-other-namespace`:
- Use the annotation:
  - `"instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs": "o11y/otel-collector"`

#### Multi-container pods with single instrumentation:

By default, the first container in the pod spec is instrumented. Specify containers with the
`instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/container-names` annotation.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment-with-multiple-containers
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-pod-with-multiple-containers
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-pod-with-multiple-containers
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/container-names: "myapp,myapp2"
```

#### Multi-container pods with multiple instrumentations:

This is for when `operator.autoinstrumentation.multi-instrumentation` is enabled. Specify containers
for each language using specific annotations like `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/java-container-names`.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment-with-multi-containers-multi-instrumentations
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-pod-with-multi-containers-multi-instrumentations
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-pod-with-multi-containers-multi-instrumentations
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/java-container-names: "myapp,myapp2"
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: "true"
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/python-container-names: "myapp3"
```

**NOTES:**
- Go auto-instrumentation **does not** support multi-container pods.
- A container cannot be instrumented with multiple languages.
- The `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/container-names` annotation will be disregarded if a language container name annotation is set.

The trace and metrics data should populate the APM dashboard.To better
visualize this example as a whole, we have also included an image
of what the APM dashboard should look like and a architecture diagram to show
how everything is set up.

## Learn by example

- [OpenTelemetry Operator and Auto-Instrumentation Example Guide](../examples/enable-operator-and-auto-instrumentation/README.md)

## How does auto-instrumentation work?

OpenTelemetry offers auto-instrumentation by using an
[operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
in a Kubernetes environment. An operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications.
In the context of setting up observability in a Kubernetes environment, an operator simplifies the management of
application auto-instrumentation, making it easier to gain valuable insights into application performance.

With this Splunk OTel Collector chart, the
[OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator#opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-injection)
can be deployed (by configuring `operator.enabled=true`) to your cluster and start auto-instrumenting your applications.
The chart and operator are two separate applications, but when used together they enable powerful telemetry data
related features for users.

The OpenTelemetry operator implement a
[MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook)
that allows the operator to modify pod specs when a pod is created or updated. MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are
essentially part of the cluster control-plane, they functionally work by intercepting and modifying requests to the
Kubernetes API server after the request is authorized but before being persisted. MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are required
to be served via HTTPS, we use the Linux Foundation [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/)
application to generate proper certificates.

For our Observability use case, the webhook modifies a pod to inject auto-instrumentation libraries into
the application container.

What does this really look like in practice? Let's describe the Java use case for this. I've deployed the chart with
everything needed to set up auto-instrumentation and I want to instrument my Java application.

- The operator auto-instruments my the application by injecting the Splunk OTel Java library
  (Javaagent) into the application container via an OpenTelemetry init container that copies the Javaagent into a volume
  that is mounted to the application container.
- The operator configures the SDK by injecting environment variables into the application container. The
  JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable is used to set the JVM to use the injected Javaagent.

### Troubleshooting the Operator and Cert Manager

#### Check the logs for failures

**Operator Logs:**

```bash
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=operator
```

**Cert-Manager Logs:**

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=certmanager
kubectl logs -l app=cainjector
kubectl logs -l app=webhook
```

#### Operator Issues

##### Networking and Firewall Requirements

Ensure the Mutating Webhook used by the operator for pod auto-instrumentation is not hindered by network policies or firewall rules. Key points to ensure:

- **Webhook Accessibility**: The webhook must freely communicate with the cluster IP and the Kubernetes API server. Ensure network policies or firewall rules permit operator-related services to interact with these endpoints.
- **Required Ports**: Policies should explicitly allow traffic to the necessary ports for seamless operation.

Use the following command to identify the IP addresses and ports that need to be accessible:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n {operator_namespace}
# Example output indicating necessary IP and port configurations:
# NAME                                          TYPE       CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP  PORT(S)                                       AGE
# kubernetes                                    ClusterIP  10.0.0.1      <none>       443/TCP                                       10d
# splunk-splunk-otel-collector-agent            ClusterIP  10.0.176.113  <none>       8006/TCP,14250/TCP,14268/TCP,...              3d17h
# splunk-splunk-otel-collector-operator         ClusterIP  10.0.254.125  <none>       8443/TCP,8080/TCP                             3d17h
# splunk-splunk-otel-collector-operator-webhook ClusterIP  10.0.222.223  <none>       443/TCP                                       3d17h
```

- **Configuration Action**: Adjust your network policies and firewall settings based on the service endpoints and ports listed by the command. This ensures the webhook and operator services can properly communicate within the cluster.

#### Cert-Manager Issues

If the operator seems to be hanging, it could be due to the cert-manager not auto-creating the required certificate. To troubleshoot:

- Check the health and logs of the cert-manager pods for potential issues.
- Consider restarting the cert-manager pods.
- Ensure that your cluster has only one instance of cert-manager, which should include `certmanager`, `certmanager-cainjector`, and `certmanager-webhook`.

For additional guidance, refer to the official cert-manager documentation:
- [Troubleshooting Guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/troubleshooting/)
- [Uninstallation Guide](https://cert-manager.io/v1.2-docs/installation/uninstall/kubernetes/)

##### Validate Certificates

Ensure that the certificate, which the cert-manager creates and the operator utilizes, is available.

```bash
kubectl get certificates
# NAME                                          READY   SECRET                                                           AGE
# splunk-otel-collector-operator-serving-cert   True    splunk-otel-collector-operator-controller-manager-service-cert   5m
```

##### Using a Self-Signed Certificate for the Webhook

The operator supports various methods for managing TLS certificates for the webhook. Below are the options available through the operator, with a brief description for each. For detailed configurations and specific use cases, please refer to the operator’s
