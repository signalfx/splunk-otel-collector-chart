# Auto-instrumentation

The process of adding observability code to your application so that it produces telemetry data is known as
instrumentation. There are two main approaches to instrumentation in OpenTelemetry: auto-instrumentation and manual
instrumentation.

Auto-instrumentation

- Usually is the easiest way to setup instrumentation for applications
- OpentTelemetry leverages Kubernetes to implement auto-instrumentation in such a way that your applications can be
  instrumented not by updating the application source code but rather by utilizing Kubernetes resources.
- Supports a subset of instrumentation libraries compared to manual instrumentation

Manual Instrumentation

- Takes more setup effort compared to auto-instrumentation but offers more customizability
- Requires editing application source code to include pre-built OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries
- Supports more instrumentation libraries and customization of the exported telemetry data compared to
  auto-instrumentation

In particular, auto-instrumentation is useful for applications that use widely popular frameworks and libraries, as
these frameworks often have pre-built instrumentation capabilities already available.

## Steps for setting up auto-instrumentation

### 1. Deploy the Helm Chart with the Operator enabled

Set `operator.enabled=true` when deploying the chart to enable deploying the operator as well.
If a cert-manager is not available in the cluster (or other TLS certificate source), then you'll need to deploy it
using `certmanager.enabled=true`. The cert-manager issues TLS certificates the operator requires. You can use the
commands below to run these steps.

_Note: In order for trace telemetry data to be properly ingested, the attribute `deployment.environment` must be on board
the exported traces. There are two ways to set this attribute._
- _Use the values.yaml optional `environment` configuration_
- _Use the Instrumentation spec with the env var OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES_

```bash
# Check if cert-manager is already installed, don't deploy a second cert-manager.
kubectl get pods -l app=cert-manager --all-namespaces

# If cert-manager is not deployed, make sure to add certmanager.enabled=true to the list of values to set
helm install splunk-otel-collector -f ./my_values.yaml --set operator.enabled=true,environment=dev splunk-otel-collector-chart/splunk-otel-collector
```

### 2. Deploy the opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1 Instrumentation

The [Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/blob/main/docs/api.md#instrumentation)
object is used to configure how your applications will be auto-instrumented. An Instrumentation object must be
available to the target pod being auto-instrumented in order for instrumentation to be successful.

For Splunk Instrumentation configurations, please see or use this [instrumentation.yaml](../examples/enable-operator-and-auto-instrumentation/instrumentation.yaml)
in our examples directory. The Splunk Instrumentation object should be installed in the namespace target applications
resides in. For example, for instrumenting applications in a namespace called `my-app-namespace` the Instrumentation
object could be installed with the following command.

```bash
# Install
kubectl apply -f instrumentation.yaml -n my-app-namespace
# Check the current deployed values
kubectl get otelinst -o yaml -n my-app-namespace
```

### 3. Verify all the OpenTelemetry resources (collector, operator, webhook, instrumentation) are deployed successfully

kubectl get pods -n default
# NAME                                                            READY   STATUS

# splunk-otel-collector-cert-manager-cainjector-6d65b6d4c-khcrc   1/1     Running
# splunk-otel-collector-cert-manager-webhook-87b7ffffc-xp4sr      1/1     Running
# splunk-otel-collector-k8s-cluster-receiver-856f5fbcf9-pqkwg     1/1     Running
# splunk-otel-collector-opentelemetry-operator-56c4ddb4db-zcjgh   2/2     Running

kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io -n default
# NAME                                      WEBHOOKS   AGE
# splunk-otel-collector-cert-manager-webhook              1          14m
# splunk-otel-collector-opentelemetry-operator-mutation   3          14m

kubectl get otelinst -n my-app-namespace
# NAME                          AGE   ENDPOINT
# splunk-instrumentation        3m   http://$(SPLUNK_OTEL_AGENT):4317
```

</details>

### 4. Instrument application by setting an annotation

An _instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-{instrumentation_library}_ annotation can be added to the following:
- Namespace: All pods within that namespace will be instrumented.
- Pod Spec Objects: PodSpec objects that are available as part of Deployment,
  Statefulset, or other resources can be annotated.
- Example annotations
  - `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"`
  - `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet: "true"`
  - `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-nodejs: "true"`
  - `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: "true"`

The instrumentation annotations can have the following values:
- "true" - inject and Instrumentation resource from the namespace to use.
- "my-instrumentation" - name of Instrumentation CR instance in the current namespace to use.
- "my-other-namespace/my-instrumentation" - name and namespace of Instrumentation CR instance in another namespace to use.
- "false" - do not inject.

### 5. Check out the results at [Splunk Observability APM](https://app.us1.signalfx.com/#/apm)

The trace and metrics data should populate the APM dashboard.To better
visualize this example as a whole, we have also included an image
of what the APM dashboard should look like and a architecture diagram to show
how everything is set up.

## How does auto-instrumentation work?

OpenTelemetry offers auto-instrumentation by using an
[operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
in a Kubernetes environment. An operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications.
In the context of setting up observability in a Kubernetes environment, an operator simplifies the management of
application auto-instrumentation, making it easier to gain valuable insights into application performance.

With this Splunk OTel Collector chart, the
[OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator#opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-injection)
can be deployed (by configuring `operator.enabled=true`) to your cluster and start auto-instrumenting your applications.
The chart and operator are two separate applications, but when used together they enable powerful telemetry data
related features for users.

The OpenTelemetry operator implement a
[MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook)
that allows the operator to modify pod specs when a pod is created or updated. MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are
essentially part of the cluster control-plane, they functionally work by intercepting and modifying requests to the
Kubernetes API server after the request is authorized but before being persisted. MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are required
to be served via HTTPS, we use the Linux Foundation [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/)
application to generate proper certificates.

For our Observability use case, the webhook modifies a pod to inject auto-instrumentation libraries into
the application container.

What does this really look like in practice? Let's describe the Java use case for this. I've deployed the chart with
everything needed to set up auto-instrumentation and I want to instrument my Java application.

- The operator auto-instruments my the application by injecting the Splunk OTel Java library
  (Javaagent) into the application container via an OpenTelemetry init container that copies the Javaagent into a volume
  that is mounted to the application container.
- The operator configures the SDK by injecting environment variables into the application container. The
  JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable is used to set the JVM to use the injected Javaagent.

Below is a breakdown of the main and related components involved in auto-instrumentation:
