  This change limits the resource attributes added to the telemetry data emitted by Java and .Net instrumentation libraries to the attributes generated by the `Container` and `Environment` resource providers.
  To enable additional resource providers, update `values.yaml` environment variable `OTEL_JAVA_ENABLED_RESOURCE_PROVIDERS` for Java, or set `OTEL_DOTNET_AUTO_{DETECTOR}_RESOURCE_DETECTOR_ENABLED` for .Net.
