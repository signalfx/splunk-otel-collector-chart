  - The `k8sattributesprocessor` was previously misconfigured in the `clusterReceiver` pipeline, resulting in all Kubernetes objects and events being enriched with pod metadata, even when it was not appropriate.
  - This led to incorrect and non-deterministic `k8s.pod.*` attributes being added to objects and events, such as enriching non-pod objects with pod fields.
  - After this change:
    - Events from the `k8s_events` receiver will no longer include `container.id`, `container.image.name`, and `container.image.tag` attributes.
    - Events from the `k8sobjects` receiver will no longer have any `k8s.pod.*` or `container.*` attributes except `k8s.namespace.name` (when applicable) and `k8s.resource.name`
  - This restores correct and predictable enrichment, and eliminates misleading data.
  - If your downstream systems or dashboards depend on the removed attributes, please update them accordingly.
