  The OpenTelemetry Operator CRDs are available under https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/tree/main/bundle/community/manifests.

  Installing those CRDs separately, before the operator, is best to avoid running into lifecycle issues. See https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/ for further reading.
