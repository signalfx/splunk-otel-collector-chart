  - The root-level 'service' parameter is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  - Please use 'agent.service' and 'gateway.service' for configuring services for the agent and gateway, respectively.
  - Helm chart gives preference to the old config for backward compatibility for now. Users are encouraged to migrate to the new config.
