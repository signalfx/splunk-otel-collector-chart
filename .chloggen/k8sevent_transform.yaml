  For example, if the log k8s event is about object type `StatefulSet`, the exported log to Splunk will have these 2 additional attributes:
  ```
    k8s.statefulset.name: value(k8s.object.name)
    k8s.statefulset.uid: value(k8s.object.uid)
  ```
  The existing attributes `k8s.object.kind`, `k8s.object.name` and `k8s.object.uid` are still present.
  In addition to these, if the event is for kind Pod, and the k8s.object.fieldPath has a specific container spec, the log will have an additional attribute `k8s.container.name` with the value of the container name.
