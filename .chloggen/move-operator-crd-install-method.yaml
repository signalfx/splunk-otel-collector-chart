  - Users enabling the operator (`.Values.operator.enabled=true`) must now set `operatorcrds.install=true` in Helm values or [manually manage CRD installation](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/auto-instrumentation-install.md#crd-management).
  - Previously, CRDs were installed using templates (`operator.crds.create=true`), which could cause race conditions and installation failures.
  - CRD installation is now handled via Helm's native `crds/` directory for better stability, using a [localized subchart](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/tree/main/helm-charts/splunk-otel-collector/charts/opentelemetry-operator-crds).
  - If you use `operator.enabled=true` you may have to follow some migration steps, please see the [Upgrade guidelines](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#0113-to-0116).
