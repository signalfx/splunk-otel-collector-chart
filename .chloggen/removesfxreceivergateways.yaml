  The `signalfx` receiver is on the path towards deprecation and removal.
  The breaking changes are as follows:
  - No metrics being sent to the gateway's `signalfx` receiver will sent to Splunk Platform anymore.
  - For metrics being sent to the gateway's `signalfx` receiver, resource and data point attributes will no longer be
  modified by the gateway. The metrics will be forwarded as-is.
  - All metrics and logs being sent to the gateway's `signalfx` receiver will no longer be subject to the
  memory limiter and batch processors. Please ensure any required memory limiting or batching is configured
  on the sending side (e.g. the agent).
  To temporarily enable the `signalfx` receiver in the gateway, you can add the following configuration to your
  `values.yaml` file:
  ```
  gateway:
    config:
      receivers:
        signalfx:
          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9943
          include_metadata: true
  ```
