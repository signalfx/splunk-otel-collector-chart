  Previously, metrics were being sent via SignalFx exporter to SignalFx receiver. This change removes
  the SignalFx receiver from the gateway's metric pipelines. The SignalFx receiver is on the path towards
  deprecation. The SignalFx exporter remains in the agent's pipeline even when the gateway is enabled, but
  its only purpose is to sync host metadata, it does not send any metrics.
