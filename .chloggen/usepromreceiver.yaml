  The `prometheus` receiver is now being used when `autodetect.istio: true` instead of `prometheus_simple`.
  The reason for this change is that the `prometheus` receiver supports filtering metrics being scraped by
  the receiver. Filtering has been introduced to only scrape metrics that are included in default content.
