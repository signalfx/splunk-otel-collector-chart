  The legacy fluentd sidecar container has been removed from the chart. All users should now use the native
  OpenTelemetry logs collection, which is the default and provides better performance and resource efficiency.

  If you still need to use fluentd for log collection, you can run it as a separate deployment using the
  official fluentd helm chart and forward logs to the collector using the fluentforward receiver.

  See the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#01370-to-01380)
  for detailed instructions.
