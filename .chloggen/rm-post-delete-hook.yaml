  The removed hook was intended to undo the ACLs set on log directores when
  runAsUser and runAsGroup are provided. An initContainer run as root-user updates
  the permissions of log directories to allow read access to the provided uid/gid.
  But there is no graceful way to revert these ACLs on each node as part of the
  chart uninstallation process.
