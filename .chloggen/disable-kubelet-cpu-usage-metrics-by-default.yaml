  `k8s.node.cpu.usage`, `k8s.pod.cpu.usage` and `container.cpu.usage` metrics are enabled by default in the kubeletstats
  receiver upstream, but we disable them for Splunk Observability users because they are not included in the default
  metrics set. If enabled, they will be charged as custom metrics. For now, `container_cpu_utilization` should still be
  used. Later, it will be replaced with one of the CPU metrics from the kubelet receiver once they are fully stabilized
  (e.g., `container.cpu.usage` or `container.cpu.time`).
