  Target Allocator is a component of the OpenTelemetry Operator.
  With this addition, the target allocator is deployed to work in coordination with the daemonset of collectors.
  It applies a default configuration applying scrape targets per node.
  By default, the Target Allocator looks for all ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor CRDs across all namespaces.
  This can be tuned by overriding the service account associated with the Target Allocator.
