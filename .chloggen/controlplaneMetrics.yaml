  Users can enable agent.controlPlaneMetrics for k8s components which run on worker nodes
  such as kubedns (gke), coredns (aks, eks) and kube-proxy (eks) with the feature gate
  featureGates.useControlPlaneMetricsHistogramData set to true.
  To disable collection of metrics from specific control plane components, set the corresponding
  component to false in the agent.controlPlaneMetrics configuration. For example:
  agent:
    controlPlaneMetrics:
      coredns:
        enabled: false
      proxy:
        enabled: false
