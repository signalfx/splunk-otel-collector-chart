  - The configuration structure for operator auto-instrumentation has changed. All settings must now be defined under `instrumentation.spec`.
  - Any configuration directly under `instrumentation.*` (outside of `spec`) will cause an error during helm operations.
  - If you use `.Values.operator.enabled=true` and have overrides for `instrumentation` settings, please review the [upgrade guidelines](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#01280-to-01290)
