note: Fix k8sattributes processor incorrectly using host.name for pod association
issues: [2183]
subtext: |
  The k8sattributes processor was configured to use host.name as one of the pod association sources.
  However, the processor expects host.name to be a pod IP address, while our collector sets
  host.name to the k8s node name.
