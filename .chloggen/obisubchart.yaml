  OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation (OBI) is auto-instrumentation that generates trace and metric telemetry for your application using eBPF technology. OBI inspects application executables and the OS networking layer to automatically instrument network communication, application operation, and more.

  The OBI sub-chart deploys OBI as a daemonset within your Kubernetes cluster. All applications within your cluster that are not already instrumented with OpenTelemetry will be instrumented. See the OBI documentation on how to customize this.

  The OBI project, and this sub-chart, are still evolving. This functionality is in an alpha stage of release. Please direct any feedback or questions through Splunk support services.
