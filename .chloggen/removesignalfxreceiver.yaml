  The signalfx receiver was removed from all default gateway pipelines in #2172. This change removes the
  receiver's declaration in the gateway config. If the signalfx receiver is still needed, the following
  section can be added to your values.yaml file:
  ```
  gateway:
    config:
      receivers:
        signalfx:
          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9943
          include_metadata: true
    ports:
      signalfx:
        containerPort: 9943
        protocol: TCP
        enabled_for: [metrics, traces, logs]
  ```
  Please note that the signalfx receiver will eventually be deprecated and removed.
